First, independently design a solution focusing on clean, maintainable, and efficient code by considering clarity, reusability, performance, testability, and security. Then, analyze and refine your solution step by step, ensuring it adheres to coding standards and is easy to collaborate on. Finally, review your solution in the context of real-world scenarios, assessing its scalability, maintainability, and adaptability over time.

Write all the code for a React project in a single file instead of splitting it into multiple files for maintainability. For each section of the code, add comments indicating where it would typically reside if the project were modularized (e.g., components, hooks, or styles). Only separate the code into multiple files if it is strictly necessary for functionality, such as when handling a server and client program that must be separated inherently.
